Three sub-repositories corresponding to the different tasks I carried out during my thesis **Evolution and Transition of Mating Systems : Two Case Studies**\\
"PAG_Bioinformatics" and "Sex_Allocation_Simulations" correspond to the bioinformatics and modeling parts respectively of the first case study, _Phillyrea angustifolia_\\
"Sex_Conflict_simulations" contains the scripts for the simulations carried out to study the second case study, _Caenorhabditis elegans_

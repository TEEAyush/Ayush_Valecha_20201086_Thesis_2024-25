Here I have the data (genome assemblies, gene annotations) and the scripts used to bioinformatically analyse them.

Various files in the "data" directory have been divided into two directories : "coordinate_files" which contains the gene annotation gff files and the "sequence_files" which contains gene sequences, alignments and even tree files generated after phylogenetic analysis

"scripts" directory contains the scripts used for the various tasks like exploratory data analysis of the pollen allergen genes (PAGs), filtering of the BLAT results ( generated by blating PAGs on the male genome ) etc.
